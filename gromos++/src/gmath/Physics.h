  /**
   * The PhysConst class holds and handles the physical constants used in
   * GROMOS++.
   * 
   * GROMOS is basically unitless which means you can feed input with any
   * physical units an get the output with the corresponding units. Some values
   * may be derived by other (fundamental) constants which are defined  in the
   * PHYSICALCONSTANTS block of the molecular topology file. These are:
   * 
   *   - 1 / (4 pi epsilon_0) with epsilon_0 the permittivity of vacuum
   *   - the Planck constant
   *   - the speed of light
   *   - the Boltzmann constant
   * 
   * Therefore, no hard coded physical constants must exist. However, the class
   * is initialised using values from literature [1] in specified units and 
   * replaces these values if the variables are reset using the set_variable()
   * functions below (e.g. when reading the constants from a topology).
   * 
   * Every constant has a corresponding bool variable which indicates the state
   * of each physical variable (initialised from literature [1] or reset, e.g.
   * when read from topology). The accessors of each variable use these bool
   * variables to print a warning message on the screen in case the returned
   * physical constant was not read from the topology file or reset on purpose
   * in the program code. This makes it still possible to do some calculations
   * without a topology file (using the values from literature [1]) but warns
   * the user to avoid any confusion when doing so.
